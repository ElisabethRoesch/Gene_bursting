visualize ABC results
1. plot marginals. we have scripts, plotting 3 epsilons, all parameters for all  models. names are "plot-data-marginals-model<insert here>"
2. sample 10 times from posterior and and simulate the selected parameter combinations. It simulates the histogram of product abundance.
compare those simulations to the observation. scripts are in folder real-data-plots "product-abundance-experimentail-vs-simul-model<inserte here>"
